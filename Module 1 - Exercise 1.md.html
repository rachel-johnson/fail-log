<p>There are many interesting annotations that my classmates have made in the first two weeks of this course, but the one which stood out to me is by <a href="https://hyp.is/xx_dBGNjEee31tfL0wpC6w/michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/">sarahmcole</a>. In response to Michelle Moravec’s <a href="http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/"><em>Writing in Public</em></a>, sarahmcole commented that having an awareness of the shortcomings within the Digital Humanities fields when it comes to diversity is important, linking Moravec’s words with those of the author’s of <a href="http://www.themacroscope.org/2.0/diversity-in-digital-history/"><em>The Historian’s Macroscope</em></a>. The article points out the neglect within digital history to discuss diversity and equality, stating that these “should play a role in every digital historian’s training”. The link between these two articles particularly resonated with me, as I have personally noticed the need to promote diversity within the field as well as within the traditional humanities. Moravec’s work within digital history in the context of the feminist movement allows for the reality that digital history and humanities is a result of diversity to become apparent. sarahmcole ties Moravec’s statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I follow in the footsteps of other women who sought to erode the distinction between public and private to reveal the politics underneath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the importance of acknowledging the previous work done to allow for the current formats of open-access academic work. I think this is very important, as without the work and contributions of previous academics, we would not have the tools we do today that allow us to facilitate open-access work. This ability to perform open-access work is what leads to the creation of diverse projects with diverse voices. As <a href="http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/">Trevor Owens</a> pointed out, open-access work allows for new ideas which “challenge historians to consider methodological questions anew”.<br>

sarahmcole’s annotation allowed me to consider the way in which open-access digital history can literally open doors to include more diverse voices within the narrative of digital history. The article <a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html"><em>Open Notebook History</em></a> showed that the ability to create open-access work would strengthen the quality of ideas and allow for greater collaboration within the field, essentially providing the opportunity for diversity and equality within digital history.</p>
