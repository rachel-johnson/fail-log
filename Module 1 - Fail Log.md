# Module 1: Fail Log

July 16, 2017
_______
What I had to do this week:
+ Respond to the readings with annotations
+ Complete exercises 1-3, possibly 4, of Module 1
+ Write a blog post about my experiences

What I did:
+ I followed the steps outlined in the workbook for [Module 1: Open Access Research](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Open-Access-Research/)
+ I completed the readings and annotated them to learn about open-access in relation to digital history.
+ I completed exercises 1-3 as outlined in the [workbook](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/).
+ I learned about markdown syntax with dillinger.io
+ I learned how to use the command line in DHBox, in order to install pandoc and create files.
+ I completed half of exercise 4 to learn how to use git to create a new branch in the command line, create a repository, push, and clone between git and Github. 
+ recorded some of my work in "command line- excerpt from today"

Issues:
+ In completing exercise 1 and uploading it to Github, the second image would not display. It shows a image box with the words "alt text", which when you select it says "*content length exceeded*". I tried adding smaller sized images, but they wouldn't show up either. 
+ I had an issue with the DHBox in exercise 2, when installing pandoc. I typed in the command prompt and it stated that there was an error because the file didn't exist. I retyped it at least 2 more times with the same result. Finally I realised that I'd been missing one letter from the command prompt found in the workbook, and was able to install pandoc perfectly fine. 
+ I made to through exercise 4 until the end of 4.6. I had some trouble is making a file a created in the command line of DHBox on a cloned repository push to Github. For some reason it said it transfered over but didn't acutally show up on Github. 
+ I was able to create a new branch and a file for that branch, but was only able to push the branch not the file. I then created a new file in the branch on Github instead of trying to push it from DHBox.

Reflections:
+ I found the exercises to be very interesting and fun to follow. 
+ They were engaging and allowed me to learn through experience rather that theory, which was refreshing. 
+ I feel that I was able to gain a basic understanding of these programs which will provide a good base for the rest of the course.
