Module 2, Exercise 1: The Dream Case

1 - Epigraphic Database Heidelberg
 - I searched for 'artifex', the Latin word for artist
 - There were only four results
 - I downloaded them into excel on my laptop
 - I found the data a little confusing, as none of it's in english and it's formatted weirdly on excel.

2 - Commonwealth War Graves Commision, Find War Dead

I searched for my surname, Johnson.
 - There were 355 pages of results for the entire commonwealth
 - I downloaded the results to excel on my laptop
 - The data is really nicely formatted for excel, and is very simple to read
 - I then refined the search to see how many of them were Canadian
 - There were only 4 pages in comparison to the previous 355
 - I downloaded the results to excel on my laptop as well
 - I found the website to be easy to navigate and that it provides well structured data
