Module 2 - Exercise 3

I downloaded the files in module3-wranglingdata as a zip file and unzipped it. 

I visited the Recovered Histories website.
The site is very well formatted to easily access the historical texts, and provides addition resources. 
The fact that the site is created by registered charity makes me believe that the sources are trustworthy.
The site doesn't really make me think the sources are not trustworthy.
It is structured in such a way that it shows a considerable amount of effort went into the digitilization of the documents. 

I located and opened *Negro Slavery* by Zachary Macaulay by browsing the collection.
I set up my workspace according to instructions, and selected page 15 from the pamphlet to transcribe.
I transcribed the entire page, and realized when I went to the next step that I was supposed to download a text editor, not use the program on my laptop which the file opened on.
I then downloaded Notepad ++ and transcribed it again.
I encoded the transcription; there weren't any people mentioned, there were a couple places, and there weren't any claims or arguments as the section was telling a story.
I had a lot of issues trying to figure out how to get the xml into a xsl file.
