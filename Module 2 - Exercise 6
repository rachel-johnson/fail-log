# Module 2 - Exercise 6

Installed Tesseracrt OCR to dhbox
Installed imagemagick to dhbox
Installed pdftk to dhbox
Tried to grab a pdf using "pdftk 83471_1957-07-04.pdf burst", and received an error that it couldn't find the file
I figured out I hadn't grabbed the file using wget, I did that and grabbed the pdf - it took a while to save
Burst the pdf into individual pages
Converted the first file 
Extracted and download the text as "output.txt"
