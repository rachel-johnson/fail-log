# Module 2: Fail Log

July 23, 2017

---
What I had to do this week:
+ Respond to one of the readings with annotations
+ Complete exercises 1-6 of Module 2
+ Write a blog post about my experience with the exercises

What I did:
+ I followed the steps outlined in the workbook for [Module 2: Finding Data](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-2/Finding%20Data/)
+ I completed the readings and annotated [Topic Modeling Martha Ballard's Diary](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/)
+ I completed exercises 1, 2, 4, and 5 with no issues.
+ I experienced issues with both exercise 3 and 6.
+ I learned about 'dream case' data by searching through two databases.
+ I learned how to use wget in the command line to download a set of files, and downloaded ten years of files from the Shawville Equity.
+ I learned how to transcribe a document and transform it into XML.
+ I installed jq to call to the API of a website to retrieve data.
+ I created a Twitter account and used twarc to create an archive of Tweets.
+ I used Tesseract make a pdf file into text using the DHBox.

Issues:
+ In exercise 3, I transcribed the page and realized when I went to the next step that I was supposed to download a text editor, not use the program on my laptop which the file opened on. I then downloaded Notepad++ and transcibed it again.
+ I then had a lot of issues trying to figure out how to get the xml into a xsl file. I tried the XML tools plugin to transform it, but received an error message.
+ I used the example as a guideline and redid the exercise. I still got the error that it couldn't create the xsl file. I tried to validate it to figure out what was wrong, and got the message that a default validation schema could not be found in XML root element. I decided to leave the exercise until I could get some help with getting the xsl file. I was able to see the XML file on a browser, but couldn't complete the exercise because of this issue with the xsl file.
+ For exercise 6, I tried to grab the pdf file in command line using "pdftk 83471_1957-07-04.pdf burst", and received an error that it couldn't find the file. I figured out I hadn't grabbed the file using wget, I did that and grabbed the pdf and was able to successfully complete the exercise.

Reflections:
+ The exercises were definitely more complex than the ones in Module 1, I found them very interesting and engaging. 
+ I was able to complete 5 of the 6 exercises, which feels like a big accomplishment for me as a beginner with these programs. 
+ I think the skills I learned in Module 2 will definitely come in handy for the final project.
