# Module 3: Fail Log
July 30

---

What I had to do this week:
+ Respond to one of the readings with annotations.
+ Complete exercises 1-2 of Module 3.
+ Write a blog post about my experiences with the exercises.

What I did:
+ I followed the steps outlined in the workbook for [Module 3: Fixing Data](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-3/Wrangling%20Data/)
+ I completed the readings and annotated [OA TEI-XML DH on the WWW; or, My Guide to Acronymic Success](http://mhbeals.com/oa-tei-xml-dh-on-the-www-or-my-guide-to-acronymic-success/)
+ I completed exercises 1 and 2 with hardly any issues.
+ I learned how to use REGEX to search for and extract data.
+ I learned how to clean data using Open Refine. 
+ I learned how to visualize cleaned data through [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)

Issues:
+ When I went to start exercise 1, the DHBox wouldn't connect. I went onto Slack and discovered that it was offline to fix the memory issue. I was able to follow the provided instrustions to complete exercise 1 without the command line. Instead I used Notepad++ on my laptop. 
+ For exercise 2, the only issue I had was I couldn't figure out how to download my cleaned file as a csv from Open Refine. I realized that I needed to do 'Export->Custom tabular exporter' when I continued with the exercise and was easily able to download it as a csv file. 

Reflections:
+ I really enjoyed the exercises this week, as they were engaging and were very interesting to learn about. 
+ I found that I was easily able to complete the exercises, and that I'm excited to come back and apply this week's knowledge to other projects and data in the future. 
+ I'm not yet sure what my focus for the final project will be, but this module has given some new possibilities.
