I created an account on Overview
I uploaded the Colonial Newspaper Database
Key words inlcuded: slavery, Native Americans, trade, emigration

I looked through the document in Overview and found it easy to navigate
The word cloud helps to visualize the most used words, making it easier to recognize the themes of the document
I looked up the word 'slavery' and found that the newspapers spoke against it, and about the abolition of slavery
I also found that the attitude towards Native Americans was supportive, though they interchangably referred to them also as 'Indians'.
