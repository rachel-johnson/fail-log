# Module 4: Fail Log

August 6

---

What I had to do this week:
+ Respond to one of the readings with annotations.
+ Complete 2 exercises in Module 4.
+ Write a blog post about my experiences with the exercises.

What I did:
+ I followed the steps outlined in the workbook for [Module 4: Analysis](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-4/Seeing%20Patterns/)
+ I completed the readings and annotated [Sonic Word Clouds: an Experiment with Data Sonification (Introduction)](https://danielruten.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/sonic-word-clouds-an-experiment-with-data-sonification-part-i-introduction/)
+ I completed 2 exercises and did part of 2 others.
+ I learned how to georectify and display historical maps.
+ I learned how to do text analysis using Overview to visualize data.
+ I learned how to input data into [Musicalgorithms](http://musicalgorithms.org/3.0/index.html) to sonify it.

Issues:
+ In exercise 8, I was able to easily rectify my historical map but ran into an issue when trying to use it as a base layer. The map wouldn't load into Palladio, I made sure to include the {} brackets and backslashes, but it wouldn't work. Someone else had this issue, but we weren't able to resolve it. I only completed the first section of the exercise. 
+ For the sonification exercises, I was unable to do the Python part as I don't have the program and didn't have enough time to delve into it, but I plan to return to it. I had issues with the Sonic Pi exercise, as I received an error message "No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen" when trying to load the data. I wasn't able to complete the exercise, as I couldn't figure out how to fix the error.

Reflections:
+ I really enjoyed learning about creative new ways in which to interpret and experience data.
+ I was particularly drawn to visualizing data and sonification, as I am very interested in art and music. 
+ I definitely want to return to these tools and programs to utilize sonification and visualization in the future. They are really unique ways in which to reinvent one's perception of data, to see or hear it through new lenses.
