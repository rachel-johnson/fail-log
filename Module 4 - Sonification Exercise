Musicalgorithms:
- I used the Roman Data provided to learn how to sonify data
- I had to properly format it, load it, edit it, and then play it

Phython:
- I don't have Python and don't know how to use it so I skipped this part.

Sonic Pi:
- I downloaded it for Windows
- I looked at the tutorial
- I tried the exercise and had I lot of issues loading the file, as it said it didn't exist
- I received the error message "No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen"
- I wasn't able to complete the exercise, as I couldn't figure out how to fix the error
