# Module 5: Fail Log

August 13, 2017

----

What I had to do this week:
+ Work on my final project.
+ Use slack as a reference for ideas and collaboration.
+ Look at this module's materials.
+ Write a blog post about my work this week for my project.

What I did:
+ I read through the manual, workbook, and slack to help me further develop my ideas for the final project.
+ I found and downloaded the zipped files that [jeffblackadar](http://jeffblackadar.ca/hist3814o_final/) shared in slack.
+ I looked at Dr. Graham's provided link for his work sonifying the Equity.
+ I uploaded the Equity files for 1960-1999 and 1901-1911 from jeffblackadar to Overview.
+ I browsed the files for mention of Norwawy Bay, and decided to use the 1901-1911 files for my project.

Issues:
+ The only real issue I faced this week was finding the time to really sit down and work on my final project. As I am working full time, and had a family wedding on Saturday, I wasn't able to dedicate as much time as I would have liked to my project this week.
+ I ran into some trouble when trying to look at the entities in Overview, as it never fully loaded. 
+ I didn't have time to start sonifying anything this week either.

Reflection:
+ I found that of the 552 documents in the 1901-1911 files, 123 mentioned Norway Bay. 
+ This gave me the opportunity to look at the way in which Norway Bay is mentioned and discussed by those in Shawville, as it is a separate place. I want to see it I can determine how Norway Bay was in the early 1900s. 
+ I need to start sonifying and develop a fuller question to answer in the next couple days.
