<p>1 - Epigraphic Database Heidelberg</p>
<ul>
<li>I searched for 'artifex', the Latin word for <em>artist</em></li>
<li>There were only four results</li>
<li>I downloaded them into excel on my laptop</li>
<li>I found the data a little confusing, as none of it's in english and it's formatted weirdly on excel.</li>
</ul>
